was recently and I gave a talk on Firebase MLKit and TensorFlow Lite. If you've
not used Firebase before, its a mobile platform by Google to make developing
Android, iOS and webapps easier and quicker. Originally Firebase was Analytics,
Admob and a database but has been expanding quite a lot over the last few
years. One of the new additions to the Firebase family is MLKit. It makes it
easier to use machine learning features in your app (both Android and iOS)
without the hassle it might otherwise be.</p>
<h2>Machine learning</h2>
<p>Officially, the definition of machine learning is "a method of data analysis
that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial
intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify
patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention". I'm not sure I
understand that definition, I think an easier way to understand what ML is, is
to compare it to traditional programming. In traditional programming, the human
writes the program and has some data and then uses the computer to get some
outputs. This could be for example writing a program to detect what fruit is in
a photo. The programmer might write rules like "if it's round and red then its
an apple" and "curved shape and yellow coloured is a banana". "round shaped and
orange coloured is an orange". This pretty quickly becomes really complicated
when adding more things to detect or more ways to detect them by (how do you
even tell a computer that something has a curved shape?).</p>
<p>Machine learning is basically flipping this around. Instead of writing the
rules for the program, you give the computer the inputs and the outputs and use
a lot of compute power and the computer will "learn" how to match the inputs to
the outputs on its own without the programmer having to write each and every
rule. The process of training a model requires a lot of processing power and
some ML expertise to design the model to do well for the task. Luckily Firebase
already has models for some common tasks and as I'll get to later, there are
easier ways to re-train a model too.</p>
<h2>MLKit</h2>
<p>There are a number of <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/#what_features_are_available_on_device_or_in_the_cloud">Ready to use
models</a>.
For most of them there is an on-device and a cloud version of the model. The
cloud models are bigger and more accurate but slower than the on-device models
since the data needs to be uploaded to the cloud first. The cloud models are
also not free. There are a few free calls per month but after that they cost.
An example of the cloud vs on-device models is the image labelling API,
on-device is trained on 400 labels and the cloud model has 10,000 and the first
1000 uses per month are free. Which one to use would depend quite a lot on the
specific use-case and if the 400 labels are enough.</p>
<p>In my talk I demoed the <a href="https://g.co/codelabs/mlkit-android-custom-model">MLKit Android
Codelab</a> and showed the MLKit
FaceDetection API. There are several modes it can do, the simplest is just find
the faces. The more complicated modes can detect the contours of the face
(shape of face, eyes, nose, mouth). It can also return the facial expression
(smiling, eyes open etc). Detection on device is fast enough to be able to
detect on the frames of a video.</p>
<p>I recommend playing with the codelab, its simple to follow and set up and play
with. These codelabs are better done on device than in the Android Emulator, I
was getting initialization errors in the emulator when I tried it.</p>
<h2>Custom TensorFlow Lite models</h2>
<p>TensorFlow Lite is a stripped down version of regular TensorFlow that is aimed
at running on mobile devices. It can only be used for inference, training will
still require big TensorFlow and Lite is a little less flexible but in giving
up that, you can run TensorFlow Lite on <em>significantly</em> smaller devices. For a
comparison, the shared library (not RAM usage, just the lib, RAM will be a lot
more) full tensorflow on my computer is ~200MB, whereas TFLite is ~2MB.</p>
<p>Building and using TFLite from scratch is not <em>too</em> difficult but Firebase
MLKit does it all much easier and is cross platform so will work on both
Android and iOS and automatically takes advantage of any hardware acceleration
the device has.</p>
<p>There is another codelab that covers TFLite called <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2-tflite/">TensorFlow for Poets
2</a>.
It is a simple camera app that detects different kinds of flowers. It's
important to follow the right codelab, there have been several versions of
TensorFlow for Poets. The old v1 is long outdated and there are 2 versions of
v2, one uses TFMobile which is deprecated and will eventually be removed from
TensorFlow in favour of TFLite. The one to use is v2 tflite that I linked
above.</p>
<h2>Transfer Learning</h2>
<p><img alt="Transfer Learning Inception model" src="https://blog.perfinion.com/2019/01/mobile-machine-learning-mlkit-tflite/files/2019/transfer_learning.png"></p>
<p>Transfer Learning is the thing that makes this codelab so easy. Here is a
diagram of the Inception architecture that is commonly used for image
recognition tasks. The lower levels of these networks are quite generic and
detect generic features of images, and the last few layers take in those
features and have output neurons for each class. Training the whole network
would take ages since its pretty big. Luckily, there is a trick that will speed
things up for us, we can take the pre-trained weights for the model and throw
away only the last layer and train our own. This "transfering" of weights is
where the name Transfer Learning comes from. (We'll actually be using the
MobileNet model but the Inception architecture image was prettier and easier to
explain.)</p>
<p>The flowers in the codelab are fine but what I really wanted to do was try and
make the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqTntG1RXSY">SeeFood app from the TV show Silicon
Valley</a>. I did the codelab like
normal first to make sure everything was working and then went to figure out
how to make it detect hotdogs vs not hotdogs.</p>
<p>To re-train the model we'll need images in two classes: 'hotdog' and 'not
hotdog'. I found a fantastic kaggle dataset that had already organized a bunch
of images and sorted them into two folders so grab that from
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/hot-dog-not-hot-dog/version/5">here</a>.</p>
<p>When you checkout the repo, there is a <code>tf_files/retrained_labels.txt</code> file
which lists the classes that the model will use. Edit that file so it has only
two lines, one class name on each line. Then put the <code>train</code> folder from the
kaggle dataset into <code>tf_files/hotdogs/</code> so you will end up with
<code>tf_files/hotdogs/hot_dog/</code> and <code>tf_files/hotdogs/not_not_dog/</code>.</p>
<p>To train our new hotdog model run this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">IMAGE_SIZE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="m">224</span>
<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">ARCHITECTURE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;mobilenet_0.50_</span><span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">IMAGE_SIZE</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">STEPS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="m">1000</span>

python -m scripts.retrain <span class="se">\</span>
  --bottleneck_dir<span class="o">=</span>tf_files/bottlenecks <span class="se">\</span>
  --how_many_training_steps<span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$STEPS</span> <span class="se">\</span>
  --train_batch_size<span class="o">=</span><span class="m">500</span> <span class="se">\</span>
  --model_dir<span class="o">=</span>tf_files/models/ <span class="se">\</span>
  --summaries_dir<span class="o">=</span>tf_files/training_summaries/<span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">ARCHITECTURE</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
  --output_graph<span class="o">=</span>tf_files/retrained_graph.pb <span class="se">\</span>
  --output_labels<span class="o">=</span>tf_files/retrained_labels.txt <span class="se">\</span>
  --architecture<span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">ARCHITECTURE</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
  --image_dir<span class="o">=</span>tf_files/hotdogs
</pre></div>


<p>That will take a few minutes to run and then will output a new
<code>tf_files/retrained_graph.pb</code> file which is the trained version of the hotdog
model. Next we need to convert the protobuf file into TFLite's flatbuffer format by running:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">IMAGE_SIZE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="m">224</span>

tflite_convert <span class="se">\</span>
  --graph_def_file<span class="o">=</span>tf_files/retrained_graph.pb <span class="se">\</span>
  --output_file<span class="o">=</span>tf_files/optimized_graph.lite <span class="se">\</span>
  --input_format<span class="o">=</span>TENSORFLOW_GRAPHDEF <span class="se">\</span>
  --output_format<span class="o">=</span>TFLITE <span class="se">\</span>
  --input_shape<span class="o">=</span><span class="m">1</span>,<span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">IMAGE_SIZE</span><span class="si">}</span>,<span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">IMAGE_SIZE</span><span class="si">}</span>,3 <span class="se">\</span>
  --input_array<span class="o">=</span>input <span class="se">\</span>
  --output_array<span class="o">=</span>final_result <span class="se">\</span>
  --inference_type<span class="o">=</span>FLOAT <span class="se">\</span>
  --input_data_type<span class="o">=</span>FLOAT
</pre></div>


<p>Then just copy the <code>optimized_graph.lite</code> into the android project and rebuild. Here is a screenshot of the final result :)</p>
