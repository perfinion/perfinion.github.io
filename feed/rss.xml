tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:141] Your CPU supports
instructions that this TensorFlow binary was not compiled to use: AVX2 FMA
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, I did too and it got me wondering how much of a difference those
instructions end up making. People often say GPUs are required for any
non-trivial ML work so I wanted to see if that was really true. I decided to
delve in and optimize TensorFlow and make it faster on my machine. I gave a
talk about this yesterday, the slides will be attached at the end as well.&lt;/p&gt;

Last years talk was only about the basics of how things SELinux works and
labels and allow rules. This year covered more of the policy side of things. I
went over now to write a Reference Policy module and did a quick demo.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jason Zaman</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 04 May 2018 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.perfinion.com,2018-05-04:/2018/05/fossasia-2018-selinux-policy-dev/</guid><category>selinux</category><category>talks</category><category>fossasia</category></item><item><title>FOSSASIA 2017 - SELinux Introduction talk</title><link>https://blog.perfinion.com/2017/03/fossasia-2017-selinux-introduction/</link><description>FOSSASIA 2017 was this weekend and I gave an introductory talk on SELinux.
&lt;a href="http://2017.fossasia.org/"&gt;The event details are here.&lt;/a&gt; There were a lot of
great talks over the three days. Engineers.sg filmed all the talks too so you

I
bumped them in Gentoo a couple days ago. They add a ton of new features, here
are a few of the main points:</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jason Zaman</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2016 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.perfinion.com,2016-10-30:/2016/10/selinux-userspace-26-released/</guid><category>security</category><category>gentoo</category></item><item><title>SELinux desktop profile in Gentoo</title><link>https://blog.perfinion.com/2016/09/selinux-desktop-profile/</link><description>SELinux desktop profiles came up on IRC earlier and I thought it might be a good idea to make a post about.
Currently in gentoo there are only two selinux profiles:</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jason Zaman</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2016 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.perfinion.com,2016-09-21:/2016/09/selinux-desktop-profile/</guid><category>security</category></item><item><title>Trusted Boot Part 1</title><link>https://blog.perfinion.com/2016/08/trusted-boot-part1/</link><description>I finally managed to get tboot working in a way that makes sense to me. For
those unfamiliar, tboot uses Intel's Trusted eXecution Technology to invoke a
dynamic root of trust and then measure all the components you boot with (eg
kernel and initrd). What took me ages to figure out was how one can upgrade
kernels while keeping this chain working.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jason Zaman</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2016 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.perfinion.com,2016-08-30:/2016/08/trusted-boot-part1/</guid><category>security</category></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://blog.perfinion.com/2016/08/hello-world/</link><description>Hello World. I've been meaning to start a blog for a while but never got around
to it. Russell Coker posted on the SELinux mailing list yesterday asking about
Planet SELinux so I figured now is as good a time as any for starting one.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jason Zaman</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2016 22:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.perfinion.com,2016-08-01:/2016/08/hello-world/</guid><category>misc</category></item></channel></rss>
