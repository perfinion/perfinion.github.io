tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:141] Your CPU supports
instructions that this TensorFlow binary was not compiled to use: AVX2 FMA
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, I did too and it got me wondering how much of a difference those
instructions end up making. People often say GPUs are required for any
non-trivial ML work so I wanted to see if that was really true. I decided to
delve in and optimize TensorFlow and make it faster on my machine. I gave a
talk about this yesterday, the slides will be attached at the end as well.&lt;/p&gt;
