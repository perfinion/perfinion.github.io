&lt;a href="http://2017.fossasia.org/"&gt;The event details are here.&lt;/a&gt; There were a lot of
great talks over the three days. Engineers.sg filmed all the talks too so you
can see them all on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQprMsG-raCIMlBudm20iLQ"&gt;FOSSASIA youtube
channel.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my talk I tried to give a quick overview of SELinux so that people would be
more familiar with the basic concepts behind SELinux. I covered DAC vs MAC,
SELinux labels and basics of how the rules are layed out. There were lots of
great questions too and we had some fun playing around with a little backdoor
shell in the webserver and the protections that SELinux had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slides from the presentation are &lt;a href="https://blog.perfinion.com/2017/03/fossasia-2017-selinux-introduction/files/2017/FOSSASIA_2017_SELinux_Introduction.pdf"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;

I gave a talk on a quick overview
of the internals of Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gdg-sg.org/2016/09/gdg-devfest-2016-coming-soon.html"&gt;The event details are here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android is such a huge topic and I barely managed to skim the surface. I tried
to cover some of the key points in Android and compare them to a regular Linux
distro. There are a lot of things that are different but also a lot that is the
same. Hopefully the talk helped give some insight to how and why things are
designed as they are.&lt;/p&gt;
