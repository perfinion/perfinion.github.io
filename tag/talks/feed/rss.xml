was recently and I gave a talk on Firebase MLKit and TensorFlow Lite. If you've
not used Firebase before, its a mobile platform by Google to make developing
Android, iOS and webapps easier and quicker. Originally Firebase was Analytics,
Admob and a database but has been expanding quite a lot over the last few
years. One of the new additions to the Firebase family is MLKit. It makes it
easier to use machine learning features in your app (both Android and iOS)
without the hassle it might otherwise be.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jason Zaman</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.perfinion.com,2019-01-04:/2019/01/mobile-machine-learning-mlkit-tflite/</guid><category>talks</category><category>firebase</category><category>tensorflow</category></item><item><title>Tensorflow - Your CPU supports instructions that this binary was not compiled to use</title><link>https://blog.perfinion.com/2018/07/tensorflow-cpu-supports-instructions/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;If you've installed TensorFlow from pip, you've probably come across this message:&lt;/p&gt;
tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:141] Your CPU supports
instructions that this TensorFlow binary was not compiled to use: AVX2 FMA
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, I did too and it got me wondering how much of a difference those
instructions end up making. People often say GPUs are required for any
non-trivial ML work so I wanted to see if that was really true. I decided to
delve in and optimize TensorFlow and make it faster on my machine. I gave a
talk about this yesterday at the &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/252770537/"&gt;TensorFlow and Deep Learning Meetup in
Singapore&lt;/a&gt;,
the slides will be attached at the end as well.&lt;/p&gt;

Last years talk was only about the basics of how things SELinux works and
labels and allow rules. This year covered more of the policy side of things. I
went over now to write a Reference Policy module and did a quick demo.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jason Zaman</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 04 May 2018 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.perfinion.com,2018-05-04:/2018/05/fossasia-2018-selinux-policy-dev/</guid><category>selinux</category><category>talks</category><category>fossasia</category></item><item><title>FOSSASIA 2017 - SELinux Introduction talk</title><link>https://blog.perfinion.com/2017/03/fossasia-2017-selinux-introduction/</link><description>FOSSASIA 2017 was this weekend and I gave an introductory talk on SELinux.

great talks over the three days. Engineers.sg filmed all the talks too so you
