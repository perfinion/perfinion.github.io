was recently and I gave a talk on Firebase MLKit and TensorFlow Lite. If you've
not used Firebase before, its a mobile platform by Google to make developing
Android, iOS and webapps easier and quicker. Originally Firebase was Analytics,
Admob and a database but has been expanding quite a lot over the last few
years. One of the new additions to the Firebase family is MLKit. It makes it
easier to use machine learning features in your app (both Android and iOS)
without the hassle it might otherwise be.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jason Zaman</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.perfinion.com,2019-01-04:/2019/01/mobile-machine-learning-mlkit-tflite/</guid><category>talks</category><category>firebase</category><category>tensorflow</category></item></channel></rss>
